Collision Algorithm

1. Calculate future player position
2. Determine if any tiles between current player position and 
   future player position
3. Cycle through tiles between current player position and future
   player position
4. Determine closest tile to player in chosen collision direction
   from these tiles
5. Set player position to 1 pixel before the tile position in
   the chosen collision direction
